# InstagramBot
This will be a fully functional Instagram web scraper/bot.

## Getting Started
Create a file in the same directory and name it config.ini
In the first line of config.ini, type AUTH surrounded by square brackets.
In the second line of config.ini, type USERNAME= followed directly by your instagram username.
In the third line of config.ini, type PASSWORD= followed directly by your instagram password.
Create a .csv file with the name "followers - Sheet1.csv" (or you can CTRL + F followers - Sheet1.csv and change the name in the code to whatever you want).

### Prerequisites
